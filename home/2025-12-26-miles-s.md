I came to Resurrection during a season when my faith felt dry and disconnected, unsure of what I was really searching for. What I found was a church where Christ is encountered deeply and faith is taken seriously. Experiencing the Eucharist and entering into the rhythms of Anglican spiritual formation brought new life to my walk with God. What once felt distant now feels alive, not as an obligation but a gift. This community has opened my eyes to the beauty of the Trinity and has truly become home.

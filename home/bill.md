# Our Story

Visiting a new church can be overwhelming sometimes. As you consider our church, we hope you will discover a loving community of believers connected to our ancient Christian roots and planted deeply here in the heart of Rock Hill, SC. Please reach out if you have any questions or need directions.

- Rev. Bill Scott

Resurrection Anglican Church is a welcoming community in the heart of Rock Hill where people of all ages can explore faith, grow in relationship with God, and belong to something deeper than themselves. As part of the global Anglican tradition, our worship is deeply rooted in Scripture and the historic practices of the church, drawing from ancient Christian rhythms that help us center our lives on the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus. Whether you’re curious about faith for the first time or returning after a long season away, you’ll find a place where questions are welcome, and hearts are open.

At Resurrection, community isn’t just a word — it’s something we live out together. From joyful Sunday gatherings to opportunities to connect throughout the week, we seek to Experience the Trinity, Embody Community, and Engage the City — inviting everyone into a life of worship, service, and genuine connection. Children are welcomed as full participants in the life of the church, and families are encouraged to grow together in faith. We’re a parish that loves this neighborhood and wants to walk alongside you however you’re journeying — with open arms and open doors.
